QuickLeads RE let's you quickly get leads from your website.

== Description ==

People shopping for real estate on the web often email or call multiple agents until they get hold of someone.  The first agent to respond to the inquiry almost always “wins” the business. Quick Leads RE shoots your leads to you via text message within seconds, giving you a huge advantage over your competition. Real estate teams and small brokerages can use Quick Leads RE to send incoming leads to multiple agents within the team or brokerage at the same time which results in an extremely fast response time. Management can see all incoming leads on one simple web page to monitor response times and lead to closing conversion. Quick Leads RE uses Twitter to handle text message distribution and lead monitoring for a very stable, reliable and easy to use system.
